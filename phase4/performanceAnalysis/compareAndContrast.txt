The average time to establish TCP connection without NAT is 3.86 ms. However, for the NAT system, the average time for connection increases to 24.86 ms.
Both approaches require:
1) The switch to send TCP SYN and FIN, ACK packet to controller
2) Send modified packet back to the switch

For Gateway system with out NAT
1) the controller have to modify the source and destination MAC address of the packet

The NAT system slows down the TCP traffic for the following few reasons:
1) When initializing the TCP connection, it has to select a random IP for the client.
2) The controller has to save the connection to its memory.
3) The controller has to generate corresponding NAT rule for TCP and ARP traffics.
4) The controller has to install the rules to Openvswitch ( transfer rules to the switch)
5) The controller has to modify the source IP in TCP SYN packet.
6) Each time, the switch have to modify destination IP address for the incoming TCP traffic.

Since the tool only tests establishment of TCP connection, the Gateway does not seem to add much overhead to time establishing TCP connection.
The NAT system appears to be much slower than the pure Gateway system even though after installing Flowmod rules, the switch doesn't have to send packets though the controller.
