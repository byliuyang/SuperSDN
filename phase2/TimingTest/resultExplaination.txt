We used the TimingTest.js script to test out timing.
This script tries to do a simple TCP connection and counts elapsed time.

We first disabled vswitch and enabled ipv4 forwarding.
Results are in the WithoutVswithc.txt
The avarage was: 0.35 ms

Then we enabled vswitch and disabled ipv4 forwarding.
Results are in the WithVswitch.txt
The avarage was: 3.86 ms

Conclusion:
When a new packet comes into the OpenFlow switch it is slowed down.
This is because the switch has to ask the controller what to do with the packet.
When this communication happens the time for a connection to be established takes longer.
This in general should not effect a big network since the OpenFlow enabled switch does not need to ask every incoming packet.
