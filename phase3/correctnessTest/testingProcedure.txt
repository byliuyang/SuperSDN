To test the correctness of our implementation, we followed the procedures below:

1) Perform DNS query
2) Extract the IP address from the DNS response
3) Record the TTL from DNS response
4) Then we try to connect to the server with the extracted IP address, making sure connection successfully estanblished.
5) Wait 5 more seconds after the TTL
6) Try to connect to server again
7) Wait for 5 seconds, making sure not able to get any response from the server.
8) Repeat step 1-7 100 times, making sure each time getting a different IP address.
